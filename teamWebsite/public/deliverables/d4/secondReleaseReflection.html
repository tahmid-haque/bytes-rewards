							A difficulty that we encountered was figuring out a way to securely 
							connect our Java Android application to our Mongo database. We 
							conducted a lot of our own research, and reached out to our teaching 
							assistant and our client for support. After following tutorials, we 
							realized that many features that allowed Android applications to 
							connect to Mongo databases were no longer supported. Following this, 
							we tried to connect the application to the Mongo database using APIs; 
							however, this feature was not easily supported on the Android emulator.
							After a conversation with our client, we decided to make our project 
							web-based so that we focus on the functionality.

							At the end of Deliverable 3, our team released a simple bingo board interface 
							that allowed users to to select goals from a drop down list of predefined goals, 
							save them to their board, and clear their board to reselect goals. We expanded 
							upon the restaurant user functionality for Deliverable 4, and began development
							for customers who will use the gamified system. In our latest release for 
							Deliverable 4, restaurant users and customers have dedicated interfaces to sign 
							up to make an account and login. Restaurant users have a customizable profile, 
							and can choose to create, view, and remove custom goals on a dedicated interface. 
							They can edit and save changes to their bingo board with pre-defined and customized
							goals, as well as rewards from a pre-defined list. For customers, when they log in 
							they can view a list of restaurants with visible profiles, and choose to view the 
							full profile or the restaurant’s bingo board.

							Deliverable 3 and 4 differed for our team in terms of progress and end result. 
							For Deliverable 3, we allotted lots of time to learn and familiarize ourselves with 
							new tools such as MongoDB and Python Flask. While lots of progress was being made in
							terms of learning and preparation for the project, the end result had very basic 
							functionality. We also found that having a sprint at the same time as a deliverable 
							caused us to spend more working time on the course than were actually being documented, 
							thus the project velocity may be too high for sprints that coincided with deliverables. 
							For the following sprints, we were able to utilize what we learned during the first 
							sprint to make significant progress. The second and third sprints remained with high 
							project velocities because there were no deliverable due dates; we were able to use the
							tools we learned in the first sprint to make progress on the project. The fourth sprint 
							occurred during the same week as Deliverable 4, so our team decided to reduce the velocity 
							to allot time for the report. As mentioned in the previous section, we added various 
							functionalities that built on what we produced in Deliverable 3. As a result, the end 
							result included more implemented features. 

							Our deliverable also differed because of feedback we received from the client. After we 
							demonstrated our first deliverable, the PickEasy team gave us feedback on our design; they
							mentioned they wanted a different way to select goals instead of a dropdown list, and a more 
							aesthetically pleasing interface. We used this feedback to design the bingo board interface 
							that eliminated the drop down list in favour of clicking and dragging goals and rewards onto 
							the game board.

							PickEasy had some inconsistencies with the timing of their Thursday 
							meetings for a few weeks, so many of our interactions with our client 
							occurred over email. The following states the date of the email/meeting
							and the questions we asked.
							</p>
							<ul>
								<strong>June 19, 2020</strong>
								<li>
								Do you want there to be a feature where customer users can see all
								their past rewards? Or is this an inventive feature?
								</li>
								<li>
								Should there be accounts for restaurant owners?
								</li>
								<strong>July 4, 2020</strong>
								<li>
								We are creating an Android app using Android Studio and trying to 
								use an API to connect to MongoDB; we are having difficulties doing 
								so and were wondering if you had any experience with this.
								</li>
								<li>
								The app is very large in size due to all the dependencies, and we 
								were wondering if you have any suggestions about deployment methods.
								</li>
								<li>
								If we are unable to deploy an app because of the above limitations,
								would a web-based loyalty program be an acceptable solution?
								</li>
								<strong>July 8, 2020</strong>
								<li>
								Should the bingo board be pre-filled with a randomized list of 
								goals for a restaurant owner?
								</li>
								<li>
								What is your opinion of the bingo editor interface in terms of design?
								</li>
								<li>
								We were thinking about having the goal tracking system be similar 
								to the coupon redemption system where a customer will present a QR
								code and the restaurant owner can scan it to accept a goal, since 
								we do not have experience with Shopify or Square. Would this be fine?
								</li>
								<strong>July 10, 2020</strong>
								<li>
								Should the customer and restaurant user interfaces be completely 
								separate (with two individual domains) or should there be one main 
								page that has two options for the two different types of users?
								</li>
							</ul>
                        </div>

						<strong>Demo of First Release: Meeting Minutes</strong>
						<p>
						On July 8, 2020 at 3:00 p.m., we demonstrated our first release to our 
						client. The following states the demonstration agenda, questions asked, and
						feedback from the client.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<strong>Demonstration Agenda</strong>
							<li>
							Show login/create account pages
							</li>
							<li>
							Show bingo editor
								<ul>
									<li>
									Explain setup of bingo board; premade goals, goal boxes,
									achievement paths, and rewards
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
							Show mockups for customer interface
							</li>
						</ul>
						<ul>
							<strong>Questions</strong>
							<li>
							What do you think of our bingo idea?
								<ul>
									<li>
									Any suggestions?
										<ul>
											<li>
											3x3, 4x4 etc.
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
									Should it be pre-filled with a randomized list of goals for a 
									restaurant owner?
									</li>
									<li>
									What’s your opinion of the bingo editor interface in terms of 
									design?
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>
							In terms of POS integration, we don’t have any experience with Shopify 
							or Square, so our group will most likely not be using these to track goals.
								<ul>
									<li>
									Instead, we were thinking about having the goal tracking system
									be similar to the coupon redemption system where a customer 
									will present a QR code and the restaurant owner can scan it 
									to accept a goal. Would this be fine?
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<ul>
							<strong>Feedback from Client</strong>
							<ul>
								<li>
								Wants customizable goals by the owner, not pre-populated
								</li>
								<li>
								We can use Qr codes for our coupon system, but prefers if we could
								integrate the project with Shopify
								</li>
								<li>
								5x5 game board with the drop down menu is fine
								</li>
								<li>
								Game board set up is not aesthetically pleasing
								</li>
								<li>
								Wants us to focus more on the execution and customer side
									<ul>
										<li>
										How the users would see and interact with the board
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>

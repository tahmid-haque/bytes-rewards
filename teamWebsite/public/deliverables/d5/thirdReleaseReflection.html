                        <strong>Estimated Project Velocities</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Sprint 5: 39 story points

                        <p>
                            Our estimated project velocity increased as some story points were
                            carried over. Also, as a part of our initial planning for sprint 6,
                            we decided to assign more than usual with the intention of carrying over
                            whatever was left into sprint 7, since sprint 7 would be our final sprint.
                        </p>
                        <strong>Actual Project Velocities</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Sprint 5: 34 story points
                                <br>
                                We were unable to complete all tasks for this sprint as school
                                    had become very busy for most of us, and for some, it was still midterm season.
                                    The remaining story points were carried over to the next sprint.
                            </li>
                            <li> Sprint 6: 49 story points
                                <br>
                                The reason we were unable to complete some of the tasks is similar to the reason for
                                the last sprint. The carry over of story points from the previous sprint and the larger
                                estimated project velocity also contributed to the difference between estimated and actual.

                            For the first sprint of this deliverable, sprint 5, we were mostly able to follow our plans,
                            since our estimated project velocity was relatively low; some story points carried over,
                            but no replanning was necessary. Our planning for sprint 6 was not followed exactly,
                            but this could be due to the fact that our plans for sprint 6 included sprint 7.
                            Again, points needed to be carried over without any replanning.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One thing we did need to replan was how to deal with the expiration dates of bingo boards, goals and rewards.
                            After receiving our client’s feedback, we held a
                            quick meeting discussing how we would solve the issue. Thus, we replanned accordingly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the whole of our project, we have mostly managed to follow our plans almost exactly.
                            As was mentioned in our previous deliverable reports, we have overcome the times where
                            our plans were not met exactly. However, some
                            features we planned initially were not able to
                            make it into our final release as we had run out
                            of time. These features were of a lower priority,
                            which is why they were left to the later sprints. However, we deemed it more important to clean up
                            bugs and our user interfaces in order to make our final product more professional.
                            Thus, we may not have followed our plans exactly, but we were able to finish the majority
                            of the features that we had planned initially.

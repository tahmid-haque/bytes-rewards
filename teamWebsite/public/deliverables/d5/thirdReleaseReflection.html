						A difficulty that we encountered occurred after our team discussed 
						integrating the feature to allow restaurant owners to choose individual 
						expiry dates for goals and rewards on their bingo board. This feature was 
						suggested by our client, as they did not think having an expiration date 
						for a 5x5 board was a good idea, as customers may not be able to complete 
						25 goals before the expiration date. While discussing the implementation 
						of this feature we discovered many problems with it. Some of these problems
						included what would happen to the completion status of a completed goal if 
						it were to expire and how a restaurant can feasibly maintain the expiry 
						dates of 25 goals and 12 rewards. 
						</p>
						<p>
						We came up with the idea that a restaurant owner could choose a smaller 3x3
						board with an expiry date for the entire board, and brought up this idea 
						with the client. They agreed this was a good solution, and thus our 
						difficulty was resolved.

							We did not have to use our contingency plan for the past 3 sprints; no

							We tried to complete as much work as possible before the project 
							deadline by assigning a higher number of story points for each sprint. 
							As a result of the higher project velocity, some stories had to be 
							pushed to following sprints. However, this did not affect our plan 
							drastically, due to our just-in-time planning strategy for each sprint.

							The following outlines the questions we asked our client, the answer
							we received, and how we implemented their feedback.
							</p>
							<ul>
								<strong>July 27, 2020</strong>
								<li>
									<p>
									<strong>Q:</strong>
									What do you think about the layout of the customer view bingo 
									board page and the highlighted achievement paths? Do we need a 
									help button for clarity?
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong>A:</strong>
									The client said that the layout of the customer view bingo 
									board page and the highlighted achievement paths were intuitive
									and a help button was not needed.
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong>How we Incorporated Feedback:</strong>
									We incorporated this feedback by not including a help button.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>				
									<p>
									<strong>Q:</strong>
									Should the goals on the customer bingo board reset after an 
									achievement path is complete or after the entire board has been
									completed?
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong>A:</strong>
									The client said the board should be cleared after the entire 
									bingo board has been completed.
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong>How we Incorporated Feedback:</strong>
									We incorporated this feedback by adding a function to clear the
									board when a customer has completed the entire board.
									</p>
								</li>							
								<li>				
									<p>
									<strong>Q:</strong>
									What do you think of the idea for restaurants to be able to 
									create a 3x3 board with an expiration date?
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong>A:</strong>
									The client said the 3x3 board idea would work, as 9 goals to 
									complete is more feasible than 25. They also mentioned they 
									would like there to be incentive to complete the entire board.
									</p>
									<p>
									<strong>How we Incorporated Feedback:</strong>
									We incorporated this feedback by letting the restaurant owner 
									choose the size of their bingo board; the options for sizes are
									3x3, 4x4, and 5x5. They can also choose the expiry date for 
									their board. We were unable to complete the feature to offer an
									additional reward once the entire board was completed due to 
									time restrictions; however, this could easily be appended if 
									the client chose to proceed with our project.
									</p>
								</li>

						<strong>Feedback from the Client and how we Incorporated their Feedback</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
								<strong>Feedback 1:</strong>
								The client did not like the lack of words and visuals on the customer 
								view board page. They especially did not like the ‘x’ to show 
								uncompleted goals.
								</p>
								<p>
								<strong>How We Incorporated Feedback:</strong>
								We incorporated this feedback by changing the image on uncompleted 
								goals to a hamburger icon, so that it looked more appealing than 
								the ‘x’. Additionally, we added a drop-down menu per each reward, 
								that shows a list of goals that the user would need to complete to 
								achieve the reward. This resolves the issue of lack of words, while
								still maintaining readability on a mobile device.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
								<strong>Feedback 2:</strong>
								The client suggested that each individual goal and reward have an 
								expiry date instead of the entire board, as completing 25 goals is 
								not feasible.
								</p>
								<p>
								<strong>How we Incorporated Feedback:</strong>
								We discussed this idea further with our client after realizing 
								problems with it. Some of these problems include what would happen 
								to the completion status of a completed goal if it were to expire 
								and how a restaurant can feasibly maintain the expiry dates of 25 
								goals and 12 rewards. We brought up the idea that a restaurant 
								owner could choose a smaller 3x3 board with an expiry date for 
								the entire board. They agreed this was a good solution, so we 
								implemented a feature that allows the restaurant user to choose 
								between a 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5 board with a single expiry date.
								</p>
